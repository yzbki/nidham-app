## FAQ

#### Why should I use this app over other list managers?

Nidham is unique because it provides a simple and dynamic user interface for checklist management. Most other list managers have too many unnecessary features and a cluttered user interface.

#### What is the utility of the AutoList feature?

The AutoList feature is incredibly useful for automatically generating lists based on a simple text prompt. You can use it to generate grocery lists, recipes, workouts, etc.

#### How does saving and loading work in this app?

Lists automatically save every change as long as they have a title and at least one non-empty task. In the future, I plan to add the ability to import and export lists so you can share them or have a backup.

#### How many lists and tasks can I create?

At the moment, you can save up to 10 lists with up to 100 tasks each.
